# Feeltheforce

Feel the force is a project made on a 24h Hackaton at the Wild Code School 

### Description

The theme of the hackaton was the Star Love and we had to use an existing data base for that. 
The app use to find the love on the galaxy. Joda starts by giving an aleatory character to the user and then the user has 2 options:
  - Choose an other aleatory character 
  - User any filter or not and let the Joda use his force to find a match
